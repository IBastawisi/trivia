# Full Stack API Final Project

## Full Stack Trivia

Udacity is invested in creating bonding experiences for its employees and students. A bunch of team members got the idea to hold trivia on a regular basis and created a  webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game, but their API experience is limited and still needs to be built out. 

That's where you come in! Help them finish the trivia app so they can start holding trivia and seeing who's the most knowledgeable of the bunch. The application must:

1) Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer. 
2) Delete questions.
3) Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4) Search for questions based on a text query string.
5) Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category. 

Completing this trivia app will give you the ability to structure plan, implement, and test an API - skills essential for enabling your future applications to communicate with others. 

## Tasks

There are `TODO` comments throughout project. Start by reading the READMEs.

We recommend following the instructions in those files in order. This order will look familiar from our prior work in the course.

## Starting and Submitting the Project

[Fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) the [project repository]() and [Clone](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository) your forked repository to your machine. Work on the project locally and make sure to push all your changes to the remote repository before submitting the link to your repository in the Classroom. 

## About the Stack

We started the full stack application for you. It is desiged with some key functional areas:

### Backend

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.7

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Enviornment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py. 

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server. 

## Database Setup
With Postgres running, restore a database using the trivia.psql file provided. From the backend folder in terminal run:
```bash
psql trivia < trivia.psql
```

## Running the server

From within the `backend` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=app.py
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

Setting the `FLASK_ENV` variable to `development` will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.

Setting the `FLASK_APP` variable to `flaskr` directs flask to use the `flaskr` directory and the `__init__.py` file to find the application. 

The application is run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` by default and is a proxy in the frontend configuration. 

#### Frontend

From the frontend folder, run the following commands to start the client: 
```
npm install // only once to install dependencies
npm start 
```

By default, the frontend will run on localhost:3000. 

### Tests
In order to run tests navigate to the backend folder and run the following commands: 

```
dropdb trivia_test
createdb trivia_test
psql trivia_test < trivia.psql
python test_flaskr.py
```
The first time you run the tests, omit the dropdb command. 

All tests are kept in that file and should be maintained as updates are made to app functionality. 

## API Reference

### Error Handling
Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:
```
{
    "success": False, 
    "error": 400,
    "message": "bad request"
}
```
The API will return three error types when requests fail:
- 400: Bad Request
- 404: Resource Not Found
- 422: Not Processable

```

The `./backend` directory contains a partially completed Flask and SQLAlchemy server. You will work primarily in app.py to define your endpoints and can reference models.py for DB and SQLAlchemy setup. 

### Frontend

The `./client` directory contains a complete React frontend to consume the data from the Flask server. You will need to update the endpoints after you define them in the backend. Those areas are marked with TODO and can be searched for expediency. 

Pay special attention to what data the frontend is expecting from each API response to help guide how you format your API. 

[View the README.md within ./client for more details.](./client/README.md)
